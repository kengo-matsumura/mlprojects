# Key learnings:

1. For classification problems, always look at the balance of majority and minority classes first.
   This can be done using a simple count plot.
   The metric trap occurs when using certain metrics to evaluate a classification model - using simple metrics like the
   accuracy score can be misleading. This is because we can achieve high accuracy by simplying 'predicting' the majority class
   for all cases, which would actually work most of the time!
